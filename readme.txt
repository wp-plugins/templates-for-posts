The same as page templates, but for posts.

== Description ==

In WordPress you can set individual templates for pages, which allows you to easily include additional functionality. Unfortunately this feature is not available for posts. Here is where this plugin comes.

After installtion you will be able to choose a template for each post the same way you do with pages.

You can find [how to your own templates](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages#Creating_Your_Own_Page_Templates) in the Codex.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload `templates-for-posts.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
